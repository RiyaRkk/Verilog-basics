# Verilog Basics

Welcome to my Verilog practice repository!

This repository contains my hands-on implementations of various digital design modules using Verilog HDL. As a recent Electronics and Communication Engineering graduate, I'm using this space to strengthen my understanding of digital systems and hardware description languages. All designs were written and simulated using EDA Playground.

## Contents

The repository includes a variety of foundational digital components such as:
- Multiplexers
- Encoders and Decoders
- Comparators
- Counters
- Adders
- Shift Registers
- Other basic building blocks of digital circuits

Each module includes:
- Verilog design file
- Testbench for simulation
- Comments for clarity

## Purpose

This repository is a reflection of my learning journey and serves as a public portfolio to:
- Demonstrate my Verilog skills
- Track my progress in digital design
- Prepare for roles in VLSI, digital logic design, and embedded systems

## Tools Used

- Verilog HDL
- EDA Playground (with Icarus Verilog)
- Git & GitHub for version control


## Feedback

Iâ€™m still learning and open to suggestions. Feedback is always welcome.
